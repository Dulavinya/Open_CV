# My OpenCV Learning Journey

This repository documents my hands-on journey learning **OpenCV**, a powerful library for computer vision in Python. Through tutorials and small projects, I explored image processing, feature detection, object tracking, and real-time video analysis.

## About

I began learning OpenCV to:

- Understand image and video processing fundamentals
- Detect shapes, edges, and keypoints in images
- Track objects and implement motion detection
- Build interactive projects like hand gesture recognition and real-time filters
- Apply computer vision concepts to robotics and practical applications

## Highlights

- Learned core OpenCV functions for image manipulation
- Implemented real-time object tracking and gesture recognition
- Explored integrating OpenCV with Raspberry Pi and cameras
- Understood performance considerations for video processing
- Gained experience with both classical CV techniques and integrating with machine learning models

## Purpose

- Keep a record of experiments, tutorials, and projects
- Share knowledge and learning progress
- Build a foundation for more advanced computer vision projects
